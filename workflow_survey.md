# Survey of existing project workflows

Rather than writing up our own workflow documentation, we collect links to
commonly used workflows. We will then use these for our understanding of
the critical infrastructure.

[Getting Involved](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html) is probably the
main page for development workflows, with the main workflows described in:

* [Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html)
* [LLVM Developer Policy](https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html)
* [LLVM Code-Review Policy and Practices](https://llvm.org/docs/CodeReview.html)
* [Code Reviews with Phabricator](https://llvm.org/docs/Phabricator.html)
* [How to submit an LLVM bug report](https://llvm.org/docs/HowToSubmitABug.html)
